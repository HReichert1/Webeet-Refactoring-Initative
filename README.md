# Webeet-Refactoring-Initative
In this project Python scripts are used to populate a database with multiple layers of Points of Interest (POIs). Each layer represents a different category or type of POI, allowing for structured, scalable data population.  During the 8 weeks of internship at Webeet.io I worked on Webeet's refactoring initiative.
